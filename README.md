Project Description: This program will be a virtual flashcard application that will help students study course material. We want to build this application because the virtual flashcards will help students study key terms and their definitions. This application will be useful for students who want to achieve higher scores in their courses.

Plan and Estimate of Effort: We plan on allocating four to eight hours per week depending on other course requirements. This plan will be adjusted as needed to meet the requirements and deadlines for the project.
